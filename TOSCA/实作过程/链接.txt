If you need to access MySQL from another server, then you need to execute these following additional steps. 
First off, create a MySQL user who can connect from any type of host using the following SQL:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theuser'@'localhost' 

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theuser'@'localhost' 

CREATE USER 'theuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '[your_pwd]' 

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theuser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION 
Next, from the AWS Management Console find the Security Group that you assigned to your instance during set-up and add 'MySQL' to the group. You can also manually add port 3306. Save and whoala ready to go!
